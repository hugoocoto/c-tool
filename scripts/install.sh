Usage: ... | bash -s -- [OPTIONS] [VERSION | nightly | uninstall]

Installs $NAME from $GITHUB/$REPO/releases. It asks what to install and
where; the arguments change what it suggests.

  VERSION              that release (v1.2.3 or 1.2.3) instead of the latest one
  nightly              the build of the last commit on main
  uninstall            remove everything this script installs
  --appimage           the AppImage instead of the static binary (it needs
                       FUSE), with its applications menu entry and icon
  --static             the static binary (the default, unless the AppImage is
                       what's installed)
  -y, --yes            don't ask, take the suggestions (also without a terminal)
  --strict             fail if the release's attestation can't be checked
                       (needs gh, logged in)
  --skip-attestation   don't check the attestation, for releases made
                       before there were any
  -h, --help           this help

PREFIX is where it goes: ~/.local by default, /usr/local as root
(... | sudo bash). A relative PREFIX is taken from the current directory.
